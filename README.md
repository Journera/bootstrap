# BootStrap 4

Journera's fork of BootStrap 4 that we will use to generate CSS files.

## Changes

We have extended BootStrap 4 to modify some of the colors and sizes. The SCSS file can be found in `scss\journera.scss`

## Building

To build the modified BootStrap library, run:

`sass scss\journera.scss journera.css`

This will produce a `journera.css` and `journera.css.map` file, use these in your projects.
